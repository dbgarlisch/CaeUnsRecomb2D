# caeplugin-CaeUnsRecomb2D
A Pointwise CAE plugin that merges 2D unstructured tri elements into quads based on a quality limit.

![CaeUnsRecomb2D Image][TriToQuadImage]

This experimental plugin converts unstructured 2D (surface) triangles to quads if a quality threashold is met. The transformed grid is saved as a Gmsh (msh) file.

Several solver attribute configuration settings are available to control export behavior.
